# Machine Learning with a Heart

Heart disease refers to several types of heart conditions and it is the number one cause of death worldwide. To prevent heart disease, we must first learn how to reliably detect it. The heart disease data that was used in this study have various measurements on patients' health and cardiovascular statistics. This repository used a various catalog of machine learning models to predict heart disease labels on the validation dataset. We evaluated the performance of each model with **logloss** metric and the model with the least logloss was used to predict the class label on the validation dataset. Our submission under [GBG-IXM](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/leaderboard/) was ranked 1st among IXM groups.
